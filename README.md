•	Developed a drowsiness detection system which triggers an alarm if eyes of the drivers remains closed for more than a specific time/interval in the counter.
•	Created the dataset by capturing more than 5000 images and labelled it as ‘open’/’close’.
•	Trained the convolutional neural network for classification and used ‘haar’ classifier to identify face and eyes from the captured image.
•	Optimized the result by increasing the hidden layers, chaning aviation function and weight initialization to attain the maximum accuracy of 89.3%.
